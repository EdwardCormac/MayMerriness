        Hi! The name's Harish. If you are reading this, you already <em>know me</em>. But if you don't, then that's fine too.
        <br>
        So, you must be wondering - <em>Just what is this project all about? Is it any <strong>different</strong> than what everyone else is doing? Or are you just another copycat who does <strong> soulless copy-pasting</strong>?</em>
        <br>
        Well, the answer is <strong>No</strong> <em>...and a partial Yes</em>.
        It really is not any different than what you will see anywhere else. Hell, I am willing to bet this might be one of the worst projects you set your eyes upon.
        After all, it is a beginner's project. <em>But...</em> where it differs is its purpose. I am making this project not for me, but for those around me. For those, due to whom I am the person that I am today. 
        <br>
        I know, it may sound cliché but yeah... That's it! Oh and by the way, this project is far FAR from over... What you are seeing right now is most probably the very first building blocks aka founding stones of this project.
